Package: AbbyyXML
Title: Read Optical Character Recognition Results from Abbyy XML Files
Description: Functionality to read the XML documents resulting from optical character recognition
  by Abbyy on an image.
  For now, the important functionality is to get the locations of the important elements on the
  page, and to plot them.  There are some convenience features to facilitate using the functions,
  e.g., methods and subscripting of documents.
  This serves a different purpose than the abbyyr package. That allows one to interact with the
  Abbyy cloud service and API, i.e. to upload documents to be OCR'ed and retrieve the results.
  That package doesn't process the results other than retrieving the contents. This is a good
  division of labor and focus in the package, i.e. not doing both.  This is teh UNIX philosophy
  of doing one thing and doing it well.
